# CausalFunnel Full Stack Developer Assignment: Simple Quiz Application

## Overview

Welcome to my submission for the CausalFunnel Full Stack Developer Intern position. I have created a Simple Quiz Application based on the provided requirements. This application is designed to showcase my full-stack development skills, attention to detail, and commitment to delivering quality work.

## Application Features

### Quiz Layout & Flow

1. **Start Page:** Users begin by submitting their email address.

2. **Quiz Questions:** The application displays a total of 15 questions fetched from the Open Trivia Database API. A timer is shown at the top of the page, counting down from 30 minutes. The quiz will auto-submit when the timer reaches zero.

### Navigation

3. **Question Navigation:** Users can easily navigate to a specific question using intuitive controls.

4. **Overview Panel:** An overview panel provides a summary of the quiz progress, indicating:
   - Which questions the user has visited.
   - Which questions have been attempted.

### End of Quiz

5. **Report Page:** After completing the quiz or when the timer expires, users are directed to a report page. This report displays each question alongside the user's answer and the correct answer, making it easy to compare.

## Tech Stack

I have built this application using React.js, a popular front-end library known for its flexibility and performance. React enables me to create interactive user interfaces and manage complex state seamlessly.

## Assumptions

I have made the following assumptions while developing this application:

- Users have access to modern web browsers.
- User email addresses will be submitted but not stored or used for any purpose beyond this assignment.

## Challenges Faced

During the development process, I encountered several challenges and addressed them effectively:

- **API Integration:** Fetching quiz questions from an external API required handling asynchronous operations and formatting the data for the application.

- **Responsive Design:** Achieving a seamless user experience on various devices demanded careful styling and responsive design techniques.

- **State Management:** Managing the application's state, including user data, quiz progress, and timers, was achieved using React's state and context API.

## Bonus (Optional)

While implementing the core requirements, I have also incorporated additional features to enhance the user experience:

- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive and compatible with the latest versions of major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

- **Smooth Transitions:** I have added smooth transitions and animations when navigating between questions to improve the overall user experience.

## Project Setup

To run this project locally, you will need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ``` git clone https://github.com/omkar-here/Quiz-App.git```
   2. Install dependencies:
      ``` npm install or npm i ```
  
3. Start the development server:
```npm run dev```

## Submission

I have hosted the application on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for easy access. You can find the live application [here](https://causalfunnel-quiz-app.netlify.app/).
